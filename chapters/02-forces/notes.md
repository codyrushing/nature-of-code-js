# Forces

Newton's third law is important.  Forces occur in pairs.  If you push on a parked truck, it will push back.

When working with forces, remember that forces are directly proportional to accelerations, and inversely proportional to mass.  When making a forces-based simulation,  __acceleration has no memory__.  If the force stops, the acceleration instantly stops.
