# Vectors

The difference between two vectors effectively creates a line between them.

Normalizing is to take a vector and make it a unit vector, ie. a vector whose length is 1.  Preserves the direction of the vector of course.  In fact, that is what it is good for, when all you want is direction.

It's a good principle that your code should really only be concerned with accelerations, since in the natural world forces move objects and forces create accelerations.  Natural motion = accelerations.
